# I'm Daniel 👋

I work as a student researcher at the [MEPHisto](https://mephisto.uni-jena.de) group at the [Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena](https://www.uni-jena.de).

The group is an initiative by the Professorship for Applied Computer Science [Prof. Clemens Beckstein](https://ki.uni-jena.de) and the Professorship for Medieval History [Prof. Robert Gramsch-Stehfest](https://www.gw.uni-jena.de/2755/apl-prof-dr-robert-gramsch-stehfest).

I am currently working on:

## Query by Graph
(My bachelor's thesis:) A collection of tools for querying RDF databases using a visual SPARQL query builder, assisted by OWL ontologies.
Find a live demo [on my website](https://quebyg.danielmotz.de) and the repository [on GitHub](https://github.com/HerrMotz/bachelor-thesis).

## πάρεδρος
An IDE for writing and debugging grammars using ANTLR4. Πάρεδρος enhances the process of extracting factoids using context-free grammars (Chomsky-type-2 grammars) from semi-structured texts. This is achieved through the integration of ontologies and debugging explanations, which can be understood by laymen.

As part of testing the IDE, we also develop grammars [Repertorium Germanicum](http://www.romana-repertoria.net/993.html) together with the [Professorship for Medieval History](https://www.gw.uni-jena.de/2755/apl-prof-dr-robert-gramsch-stehfest).
 
## HisQu
A joint project with the [University of Göttingen](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/) which makes factoids retrieved from semi-structured sources available in DSLs (e.g. results achieved with πάρεδρος available) and then algorithmically transforms them into [FactGrid](https://database.factgrid.de/wiki/Main_Page)-triples.

## On the side...
... I write articles on my [personal website](https://www.daniel-motz.de/) and do some charity work.
