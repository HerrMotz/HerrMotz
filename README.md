# I'm Daniel 👋

I work as a student researcher at the [MEPHisto](https://mephisto.uni-jena.de) group of the [Friedrich-Schiller-Univeristy Jena](https://www.uni-jena.de).

The group is an initiative by the Professorship for Applied Computer Sciences [Prof. Clemens Beckstein](https://ki.uni-jena.de) and the Professorship Medieval History [Prof. Robert Gramsch-Stehfest](https://www.gw.uni-jena.de/2755/apl-prof-dr-robert-gramsch-stehfest).

We currently work on:

## πάρεδρος
An IDE for writing and debugging grammars using ANTLR4.
 
## HisQu
A joint project with the [University of Göttingen](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/) which makes factoids retrieved from semi-structured sources available in DSLs (e.g. results achieved with πάρεδρος available) and then algorithmically transforms them into [FactGrid](https://database.factgrid.de/wiki/Main_Page)-triples.

# On the side...
... I write articles on my [personal website](https://www.daniel-motz.de/) and do some charity work.
